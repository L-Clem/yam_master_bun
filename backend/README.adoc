ClÃ©ment LAFON
v0.2
:toc:
:hide-uri-scheme:

This code is part of a bigger project that makes an application to play the Yam Master.


== Technical Stack

== Requirements 
- Bun >= 1.1.6 (https://bun.sh/docs/installation)

== Why rewrite?
I rewrote the base written by Julien simply to reappropriate myself the code, understand it more finely and challenge myself on an aspect that interested me.

== Features

== Environment Variables

This feature needs for the server to run with *Bun*. If not you will have to install the *dotenv* package and import it on the `index.js`.

You can activate the dev features of the backend by setting this variable to "dev".

`ENVIRONMENT`:: 
- "dev" (development)
- "" (production)
